The phenotype file is slope_residuals_model4_aa_wt_20181231.txt.
The formula is invn_clean_slope_aa_wt_model4=.
The suject ID column in the phenotype file is sampleid.
The family ID column in the phenotype file is sampleid.

The VCF file is /proj/epi/Genetic_Data_Center/whi_share/whi_1kgp3/AA/WHI_AA/chr22.dose.vcf.gz.
Analyze dosage data in the VCF file.

Unweighted analysis will be performed.

The log file is test_hetero4.log.

Perform linear regression.
Allow residual variance in different groups (defined by flag_q_fu_wt_aa) to be different.
Use model-based variance estimators.

Perform Wald tests.
Perform standard association analysis.
The results file is test_hetero4.wald.out.
